## To run:

### Try running this, and pip install whatever missing libraries there are. Not very professional but if it works it works

### Run
```bash
pauses_articulation.py
```
In the data directory prompt, paste the path to the *Current folder*.
In the audio file prompt, paste the *name* of the `.wav` file without the extension name. It should also be in the same directory.
