would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night? no. with your data included in the data sold to the malicious third parties? yes it was. are you willing to change your business model in the interest of protecting individual privacy? congresswoman I'm not sure what that means.if you've messaged anybody this week would you share with us the names of the people you've messaged? senator no I would probably not choose to do that publicly here. how do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service? senator we run ads. do you track devices that an individual who uses Facebook has that is connected to the device that they use for their Facebook connection but not necessarily connected to Facebook? I'm not I'm not sure the answer to that question. really? yes. how long do we have to wait for that kind of investigation? congresswoman we expect it to take many months. will you commit to changing all the user default settings to minimize to the greatest extent possible the collection and user and use of users data? congressman this is a complex issue that I think is deserves more than a one word and again that's disappointing to me.
